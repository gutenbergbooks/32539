<h1>EIGHT DAYS IN NEW-ORLEANS</h1>

<h2>IN FEBRUARY,</h2>

<h1>1847,</h1>

<h2>BY ALBERT J. PICKETT,</h2>

<h3>OF MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA.</h3>





<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<p>The following Sketches of New-Orleans originally appeared in the
Alabama Journal of Montgomery. For the purpose of presenting
them to the perusal of his friends at a distance, the author has caused
them to be embodied in the present form.</p>

<p>These pages were written from the recollection of only a few days
sojourn in the Crescent City. The period allowed the author of
collecting information was very limited. It is also his first essay at
descriptive and historic writing. The author fondly indulges the hope
that these things will be taken into consideration by his charitable
friends, and will cause them to cast the veil of compassion over imperfections.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.&mdash;DESOTO'S EXPEDITION,&mdash;HIS DEATH,&mdash;THE FATE OF HIS PARTY, ETC.</h3>


<p>On a recent excursion to the Crescent City, I collected some
facts and statistics which are respectfully submitted to the public.
In attempting a description of this magnificent emporium of commerce,
as it exists at the present day, I will briefly allude to its
early history, commencing with the great "drain" of the western
world, which is destined to bear upon its turbid bosom half
the commerce of the American Union.</p>

<p>Three hundred and thirty years ago the noble Mississippi rolled
its waters to its ocean home in native silence and grandeur, hitherto
seen by no European eye, when suddenly one morning
<span class="smcap">Hernandez De Soto</span> stood upon its banks. How awfully sublime
must have been the contemplations of that man. He had
discovered it a thousand miles from its mouth, two thousand from
its source. No one had ever seen its rise,&mdash;no one its exit into
the ocean. But it was reserved for the Governor of Cuba to find
it through a wilderness, at a place and under circumstances the
most thrilling and romantic. Four years previous to this discovery,
he embarked for Florida with an outfit of a thousand men,
with arms, munitions, priests and chains. His object, the conquest
of a country teeming with wealth and splendour, like that which
his former Captain found in the conquest of Peru. He penetrated
Florida, Georgia and Alabama, finding no gold&mdash;no splendid Montezuma&mdash;nothing
but savages breathing out an innocent and monotonous
existence, inhabiting a country in a state of nature alone.
After hardships the most unheard of, disappointments the most
mortifying, the proud and enterprising De Soto threw his troops
into Mauville, a large town near the confluence of the Bigby and
Alabama. Here a most disastrous battle attended him, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
although he routed the enemy in the death of thousands, he lost all
his baggage and most of his horses. His fleet then lay at the bay
of Pensacola, awaiting his arrival, and by reaching it in a few days
he could have terminated his disastrous campaign. But the proud
Castilian was not to be subdued by misfortunes and disappointments.
He determined to find just such a country as he had constantly
sought. Fired with fresh intelligence of the magnificence
of the people who lived near the "Father of Waters," we find
him pursuing his expedition in a sun-set direction in company
with his jaded, reduced and dispirited force, with a fortitude and
courage which none but a Spaniard knows. He surmounted innumerable
difficulties, which both nature and man interposed to
arrest his progress; and finally, through a dense and almost endless
forest, he suddenly gratified his vision with the majestic Mississippi.
Crossing over the great river, he toiled in the prairies
and swamps of Arkansas and Missouri, until wants and vicissitudes
of the most trying character impelled his return. Arrived
once more upon its virgin banks, his lofty spirit fell, and brooding
over his fallen fortunes, a fever terminated his existence far from
home, in the American wilds!</p>

<p>Just before he passed from life, he caused his officers to surround
his bed, appointed Luis de Muscoso his successor in command,
and bid them an affectionate farewell. He also had his soldiers
introduced by twenties, endeavored to cheer their drooping
spirits, (who were now inconsolable at the loss of their great
leader,) exhorted them to keep together, share each other's burthens,
and endeavor to reach their native country, which he was
never to see. To conceal his body from the brutalities of the natives,
it was encased in an oaken trough, and silently plunged in
the middle of the channel, at the dark and gloomy hour of midnight,
and the muddy waters washed the bones of one of the noblest
sons of Spain!<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>A</sup></a> Thus was the Adelantado of Florida the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
to behold the Mississippi river; the first to close his eyes in death
upon it, and the first to find a grave in its deep and turbid channel.</p>

<p>Muscoso and his remaining troops, now annoyed by the natives,
by hunger and disease, built some vessels, and dropped down the
river, in the hopes of reaching Cuba. And three hundred and
thirty years ago these adventurers silently floated by the spot where
New Orleans now stands! No hand had ever felled a tree,&mdash;no
civilized voice had ever echoed among the forests of that place.
But nature, eternal nature, ruled supreme. The poor fellows went
out at one of the mouths of the river, and a tremendous tornado encountered
and dispersed them. But few lived to reach home.</p>

<p>The several journalists of that expedition describe the Mississippi
river of that day exactly as it is at present, in respect to
several things, "a river so broad that if a man stood still on the
other side, it could not be discerned whether he was a man or not.
The channel was very deep, the current strong, the water muddy
and filled with floating trees."</p>

<p>A long century was added to the age of the world before the Mississippi
river was beheld again by civilized man. Col. Woods,
of the Virginia colony next saw it, and crossed it. Marquette, in
1673, started at its source, and came down as far as the Arkansas.
The Chevalier de la Salle, some years after this, commenced near
its head and descended to the gulf, with seventeen men. Having
returned to France, he fitted out an expedition, but his vessels
were unable to find the river. He made another voyage, but
could not find its mouth. Iberville was the first voyager that ever
entered this river from the ocean, and he erected a fort at Biloxi,
near Mobile, in 1697.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE EARLY SETTLEMENT OF NEW ORLEANS,&mdash;OF BILOXI,&mdash;NATCHEZ.&mdash;GOVERNOR
IBERVILLE AND HIS SUCCESSOR.</h3>


<p>Iberville, the father of Louisiana, having formed a settlement
at Biloxi, by erecting a fort and leaving a garrison, proceeded up
the river, and established a town at Natchez, on that splendid
bluff which towers above the angry waters of the Mississippi.
On his departure for France, his brother, Bienville, was made Governor,
and he appears to have been anxious to procure a more
eligible site for the capitol of the province than either of those
which his predecessor had selected. Dropping down the vast current
he most patiently made a thorough examination of the banks
from Natchez to the gulf, and finally determined to make the Crescent
Bend the future capitol. His judgment was good, although
the visitor frequently wonders why the city was not placed nearer
the ocean. It was, perhaps, the most elevated spot convenient to
the outlet, and was certainly nearest Lake Pontchartrain, upon the
commerce of which the founder no doubt made reasonable calculations.
But whether the settlement of New Orleans was the
result of accident, as many suppose, or of well conceived design, it
matters but little. It was selected by Bienville, and he threw fifty
able men forthwith into the forest to felling the trees, exactly one
hundred and twenty-nine years ago! In defiance of the united
opposition of Natchez and Biloxi, the Governor pushed forward his
work. It appears that in the very outset this place encountered
difficulties of various kinds, which thwarted its prosperity for nearly
a century. While only one year old, the Mississippi rising to an
unprecedented height, swept away every vestige of human innovation.
Being totally abandoned for three years, it was again settled
by Delorme, "who acting under positive instructions, removed
to it the government establishment." In the following year it contained
about one hundred houses scattered in all directions, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
no regularity, with no dyke to protect them from the rolling
waves, no fort to repel the incursions of the Indians; without
the smallest luxury and comfort, without society, without religious
enjoyment, reduced by disease and assailed by the venom of every
tropical insect, did these enterprising sons of France struggle for
existence and a town. No sooner were they left to some kind of
repose than they were visited by a dreadful tornado, which blew
away their houses, destroyed their shipping, and ruined their gardens.
But New Orleans has risen above all disasters and opposition.
One of the most remarkable characters of that day was
Governor Bienville. He must have been a determined man, with
great good sense, and had the confidence of the citizens. He
was made Governor three times, and for many years exercised a
salutary influence over the destinies of Louisiana.</p>

<p>A few years after this period, a body of Jesuit priests and nuns
arriving from France, gave a new impetus to the town. They made a
most fortunate location, and their property greatly augmented in value.
But these pious adventurers were also to be disturbed. The Pope
of Rome not only expelled that sect from Europe, but pursued
them in American exile. Their property in New Orleans, variously
estimated to be worth now, from fifteen to thirty millions,
was then confiscated and sold for one hundred and eighty thousand
dollars. These unfortunate people still further had to satisfy the
tyrannical decree to the full measure, by leaving Louisiana!
Fifty-one years elapsed from the settlement of
Orleans until it was
visited by that dreadful disease, the yellow fever, and we may ascribe
that affliction, as we may do many other entailed evils, to
the English. They introduced it by importing to Louisiana a
cargo of slaves; and now these philanthropists would be willing
to see our nation exterminated, and our throats cut, because we are
pursuing a system of mild domestic slavery, when they imposed it
upon us in the most heartless and aggravated form, by kidnapping
and robbery!!! But I am digressing.</p>

<p>To terminate this very rapid and imperfect sketch of the history
of Orleans, I will introduce a brief summary, with the remark,
however, that the Louisianians had every impediment thrown in
their way in endeavoring to become a prosperous and happy people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
They were handed over by the French government to a
chartered company, who afterwards returned them to the government.
They were then sold to Spain, and a remorseless governor
of that nation introduced a system of plunder and oppression. Afterwards
Spain ceded this country again to France, and France
sold it to the United States for fifteen millions of dollars! A sum
that startled many of our economical republicans of that day, but
which, compared to the advantages of the purchase and the revenue
since derived, was a most paltry sum. In 1778 a fire consumed
nine hundred houses. In 1785, seventy years after it was
founded, the population was only four thousand seven hundred and
eighty. In 1791 the first comedians arrived from Cape Francois.
In 1800 Spain receded the province to France, and it was purchased
by the United States in 1803. In 1810 the population
amounted to twenty-four thousand five hundred and fifty-two souls:
Ever since the cession to the United States the strides of the city
of Orleans have been rapid, and her march onward!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>GEN. JACKSON.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS.&mdash;THE POPULATION AT THAT DAY, AND OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE CRESCENT CITY.</h3>


<p>The most extraordinary man that ever lived in any age or country,
was Gen. <span class="smcap">Andrew Jackson</span>. From youth to the last moments
of his life, he swayed the minds and actions of men beyond
anything on record. Buonaparte, with all his power, was at last
subdued, and died at St. Helena as harmless as a child. The
venerated "Father of his country" lost much of his popularity
and influence after he retired to Mount Vernon.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>A</sup></a> Nearly all the
great men of whom we read, lose to some extent their position
towards the close of their lives. But Gen. Jackson retained his influence
so long as the breath remained in his body. While retired
at the Hermitage, divested of all official power, with a weak and
attenuated frame, bowed down with disease and tottering to decay;
whilst the last light was flickering in that once refulgent lamp,
did this masterly and commanding man dictate the nomination of
a President, and achieve, through his expressed opinions, the annexation
of Texas!! This is mentioned, not by way of political
boasting, but to show the powerful influence he exerted over the
destinies of this Union, even when the hand of death was upon
him! It was the efforts of this distinguished Captain which saved
New Orleans in 1814. No sooner had that devoted city become
free from that despotic and ruinous policy which had for a century
crippled its energies, no sooner had it been made a member of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
our family, than the ruthless hand of fate was down upon it once
more. To sack it, to dishonor it, there were ready encamped on
its outskirts eight thousand chosen troops, who had fought under
Wellington in the peninsular war; veterans in service, and the
flower of the British army.</p>

<p>General Jackson reached Orleans under the most embarrassing
circumstances. His troops numbered only four thousand, as undisciplined
as children of the forest could be, with few arms and
but little ammunition. The population of the city was made up
principally of French, Spanish and Dutch, who knew not our laws,
who were aliens in feelings, who had never heard of Jackson, but
who looked upon his raw troops with doubt and dismay, while the
splendid numbers in the British lines over-awed and intimidated
them. Among this mixed and doubtful mass, it was the aim of
the American commander to inspire confidence and make them
stand by him. In the darkest hour of his deepest embarrassment,
when mutiny and riot stalked over the infatuated city, when much
of the talent and influence of Orleans was at that moment employed
in overtures to the enemy; in that dark hour that tortured the
commander's soul, a large deputation of French ladies implored
him with tears and lamentations, to surrender the city and save
their lives and persons. When informed by his aid, Col. Livingston,
who was familiar with the French language, the nature of
their visit, this great native Captain, this commander by the creation
of his Maker, rose in his stirrups and said, in a loud voice,
"Tell them, Colonel, to rely upon me, I will protect them, defend
the city, and save it!" Jackson carried out his bold declaration,
which seemed groundless when made. No man but him had
nerve enough to make, and none to demonstrate it under such unfavorable
circumstances. In a conversation with the Duke of
Wellington, not long since, that distinguished soldier remarked to
Col. King, our Ex-Minister to France, "that taking into account
the disparagement of the opposite forces and the number slain on
either side, the battle of New Orleans was unrivalled in the annals
of warfare." Only seven Americans paid the debt of war, while
the bloody field was covered with two thousand sons of Britain!</p>

<p>After the defeated troops had embarked for England, and peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
being declared, the Crescent City, relieved of many of its tramels,
made the most mastodon strides to wealth and fame. Her population
increased rapidly in despite of the yellow fever, which
annually swept off thousands. As disease made fearful lanes
through the ranks, the avenues were immediately filled by fresh
pioneers invited by the inducements which her commerce held
out. The population of New Orleans in 1810 was 17,242; in
1820, 27,126; in 1830, 46,310; in 1840, 102,193; and at this
time it amounts to 170,000 souls! In regard to her population
Orleans is not unlike Astor with his money. Each have arrived
at that prosperous state when it requires but a few years to double
their numbers.</p>

<p>When Napoleon sold Louisiana to Mr. Jefferson, the condition
of Orleans was poor indeed compared to its present imposing and
magnificent appearance. Norman, a writer, says "at that time
the public property transferred to us consisted of two large brick
stores, a government house, a military hospital, powder magazine
on the opposite side of the river, an old frame custom-house, extensive
barracks below those now remaining, five miserable redoubts,
a town-house, market-house, assembly room and prison, a
cathedral and presbytery, and a charity hospital." The Second
Municipality, which now contains a population of fifty thousand,
with lofty and compact buildings, the centre of trade and enterprise,
where now towers the conspicuous St. Charles and comfortable
Verandah, was not many years since a sugar plantation belonging
to Monsieur Gravier. In 1823, the enterprising Caldwell
erected the American theatre on a portion of this field, and
was considered a madman for building in the country. The lovers
of the drama could only reach the theatre upon the gunwales of
flat-bottomed boats, but how soon was this isolated building surrounded
by wealth, beauty and fashion!</p>

them that Washington was the purest and greatest man that ever lived, I say
that Jackson was the most brilliant of the two, and exercised more influence
over the people than any other man that ever lived!</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>NEW ORLEANS IN 1847.&mdash;ITS EXTENT AND SITUATION.&mdash;LAFAYETTE.&mdash;CARROLLTON, ETC.</h3>


<p>Omitting an account of the many deadly quarrels which were
constantly fermented with the Indians&mdash;of the battles of the Louisianas
with the Spanish and English&mdash;of the horrible and unparalleled
murder of twelve of the principle citizens of Orleans, by the order of
O'Reilly, the Spanish commandant, who had invited them to one
of his banquets&mdash;nay, of a thousand interesting things connected
with the history of this romantic city, which could not have been
embodied in these hasty numbers, I proceed to consider its present
condition and prospects.</p>

<p>The bend of land which sustains all this magnificence and
wealth, is very much like that opposite Montgomery. A citizen
acquainted with our localities, may very justly imagine New Orleans
to commence on the west side of the Alabama, below Jackson's
Ferry, continuing on by Bibb's gate and terminating just
below town.&mdash;Opposite old Alabama town he may suppose the
city of Lafayette to commence, then, further on, the town of Bouligny,
and then Carrollton.</p>

<p>The city proper is, by the river, five miles long, and will average
three-fourths of a mile wide. Then commences Lafayette,
which extends up the river two miles further, and, as they are so
intimately connected and associated, it all may be considered as
one vast place, seven miles in extent. After a succession of
splendid mansions, farms, and other houses, the whole resembling
a continued village, Bouligny and Carrollton unite with the chain
of commerce. A century from this date, Orleans, like London,
will reach out her arms and encompass within her limits every
town and hamlet for miles around. As London swallowed up
Westminster, Southwark, Lambeth, and Chelsea, so will Lafayette,
Bouligny, Carrollton, and others adjacent be lost in her future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
immensity. It will then all be New Orleans, the largest city
on the continent of America, and perhaps in the world.</p>

<p>The foundation consists of a plain inclining from the river, and
when looking from the St. Charles to the Levee, the singular
spectacle is presented of ships and boats standing raised up before
you, and the little rivulet in the street, just after a rain, running in
a smart current by you and losing itself in the swamp, as if afraid
to mingle with the "Father of Waters." As health and cleanliness
are greatly promoted by this gentle inclined plain, it is most
fortunate that Orleans is so situated. In ancient times the inhabitants
were either amphibious or lived at great sufferance from the
floods. But now they are protected by the Levee. A stranger
however, upon the impulse, would think that protection uncertain.
But if he would reflect for a moment, he would wisely determine
that it requires not a very strong dyke to pen up the surplus water
during a freshet, for the main current is confined by immense
banks reaching far, far below. To render my position more palpable,
suppose the river should suddenly dry up, Orleans would
then be standing on a bluff three hundred and sixty feet high, for
that is the depth of the river opposite the city. The foundation, a
low alluvial bottom, has been much improved by draining and filling
up. No building is erected without the foundation is
made firm by piling with long logs driven down with immense
force; but very massive buildings, even with this precaution, will
continue to settle. It is said that the St. Charles is two feet
lower now than formerly. Three great streets divide the city into
municipalities. Between Canal and Esplanade, lies the first
Municipality, between Esplanade and the lowest street on the outskirts,
far down the river, lies the Third Municipality; and between
Canal and Felicity, is the Second. They are wide and
beautiful streets, running perfectly straight from the river to the
farthest back limits, serving not only as boundaries for municipal
purposes, but absolutely separating different races. The everlasting
Yankees, with their shrewdness and enterprize, inhabit the
Second Municipality; the wealthy French and Spanish fill up the
First, with a large mixture of native Americans; but the Third
Municipality is entirely French and Spanish. It was impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
for me to ascertain how many streets run through the city, but
there are many. No fault can be found of the topography of Orleans,
and it is strange that the regularity of the thorough fares should have
been so well preserved under all the changes and vicissitudes
through which she has passed. Everything is of
interest
here; even the names of the streets attract the notice of the visitor;
and as he rides along, he may trace the different races who
have formed and named them. He will pass through streets which
the descendants of Spain first laid out, such as Esplanade, Ferdinand
Casacalvo, Morales, and Perdido. Again his eye will
glance at French names, such as Josephine, Bourbon, Chartres,
Notre Dame, Dauphin, and Toulouse. Then there are various
streets bearing the names of all the saints known to the Catholic
devotee. In respect to names very little of Orleans has been
Americanized. Occasionally you will meet with such names as
Commerce and Canal, which doubtless sound very vulgar to the
the French. But the master street of the world is the great Levee,
usually from two to five hundred feet wide from the river
to the buildings. From this great thoroughfare all others diverge,
and it is the greatest mart of its extent in the world. While I
was there, <span class="smcap">THIRTY-SIX THOUSAND BARRELS OF FLOUR</span> were sold
in a few hours! And while this astonishing transfer was going
on, thousands of other produce and commodities were changing
hands. Many years ago it was used as a fashionable promenade
to enjoy the breezes of the Mississippi. Commerce has changed
its character entirely. Now scenes of the most intensely exciting
character are upon the Levee. The very air howls with an eternal
din and noise. Drays and wagons of all descriptions, loaded
with the produce of every clime, move on continually in
one unbroken
chain. Ships from every nation, whose masts tower aloft
in a dense forest for five miles, with thirty thousand sailors and
stevedores, busily loading and unloading, stand in your view.
Steamboats, and crafts of every make and shape, from every river
which empties into the Mississippi, are here mingling in the
strife of commerce. The rough and homely produce of the far
and cold Iowa&mdash;of the distant Wisconsin&mdash;of the black and stormy
Northern Lakes, is here thrown upon the Levee in hurry and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
confusion mingled and mixed with the sweets and luxuries of the
sunny tropics. Here, too, the various races of men astonish one.
The Kentuckian with an honest and ruddy face; the Yankee with
his shrewd and enterprising look; the rich planter of Mississippi;
the elegant and chivalrous Carolinian; the sensible and honest
citizen from the "Old North State;" the lively, fine-looking, and
smart Georgian; the talented and handsome Virginian; the
swarthy creole sugar planter; the rough hunter from the gorges
of the Rocky Mountains&mdash;all natives of the Union&mdash;all freemen
alike&mdash;all meet upon this common ground of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span> and
<span class="smcap">Commerce</span>.
And this picture must be carried out with the children
of <i>adoption</i>. Here is also the dark and mysterious Spaniard puffing
his cigar and sending up volumes of smoke through his black
imperials; the gay and frisky Frenchman; the sturdy Dutchman;
the son of Erin, and the cunning Jew. A trite adage says that
"it takes all kinds of people to make a world;" verily, then, the
Levee is a world.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE CATHEDRAL.&mdash;ORPHAN'S ASYLUM.&mdash;THE SISTERS OF CHARITY, ETC.</h3>


<p>Immediately opposite the Place d'Armes, and fronting the
levee, rises in solemn grandeur, the celebrated Cathedral. It
must be very old, and was said to have been erected through the
zealous munificence of Don Andre Almonoster. Connected with
the building is a story curious and romantic, and from all I could
learn no less true. When Don Andre died, he exacted of the
priesthood the positive injunction, that every Saturday evening
prayer should be offered up for his soul, and in default thereof the
property was to pass into other hands. From that day to this, in
fulfilling these extraordinary stipulations, not a solitary omission
has been made. And as you stand about sundown at the Cathedral,
you will hear the doleful bell mournfully recalling the memory
of the departed Don Andre! I was there at that hour. The
dark and frowning church towered far above me. The deep-toned
bell echoed its mournful sound until twilight began to mantle
the city with her sable curtains. I thought of Don Andre. I
thought of his injunction; I thought of his soul, and I turned from
the consecrated place with feelings the most singular and solemn.</p>

<p>The edifice in appearance is grand, antique and venerable.
Judging from the disregard to repairs, I should conclude it was
designed for it to remain so. Built of brick, with very thick walls
and stuccoed, it nevertheless looks black and dingy, all which
assists to make it more imposing to the stranger. A large door
in the middle will let you into the ante-chamber, and from this by
a door on the right and one on the left, you enter the immense
chapel. Passing by two large marble basins filled with holy
water, where devotees sprinkle and cross themselves upon entering;
you are by the side of the "confession boxes." There are
three on each side, each about ten feet high and eight feet square,
with three apartments or stalls; the middle one for the priest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
the other two for those wishing to lay down their burden of sins.
The priest standing in the middle hears an account of the transgressions
of the one on the right through a small grated window,
while the one on the left is kneeling until his fellow-sufferer gets
through. All that can be heard is a low whispering and murmuring
throughout all the confessional boxes, where six priests
are continually officiating. When the penitent is dismissed by
the holy father, he appears to be a happier man, and on coming
out of the box immediately kneels before the altar, and another
person takes his place.</p>

<p>This system of confession is often denounced; I do not pretend
to defend it, but there is much excuse for it. What Protestant is
there who in deep trouble, does not find relief in disclosing those
troubles to an old confidential person in whom he can confide,
and who gives him good advice? Are not the cases somewhat
similar?</p>

<p>I watched and listened attentively to see or hear the settlement
between the father and sinner, but I made no discoveries
and heard no money jingle. All classes unite here in the
services, and as you cast your eye over this devout assembly,
the elegant young lady may be seen kneeling on the hard stone
floor, beside the negro or mulatto. And still further on, the well-attired
gentleman prostrates himself with the ragged beggar in
worshipping the same common and universal God! All appear
to be deeply engaged, and in no church can there be found so
much profound silence, awe and veneration. The three altars
are so far distant that the fathers are seldom heard, and the worshippers
are governed in their devotions by the ringing of bells.
There is nothing very imposing in the interior, some very fine
paintings representing incidents in the Bible, hang around the
walls.</p>

<p>In regard to the public buildings, "there is probably no city
in the United States that has so many benevolent institutions as
New Orleans, in proportion to its population. Certainly it
has not an equal in those voluntary contributions which are
sometimes required to answer the immediate calls of distress.
Here assembled a mixed multitude, composed of almost every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
nation and tongue, from the frozen to the torrid zone, and whether
it be the sympathy of strangers, or the influence of the
"sunny south," their purses open and their hearts respond like
those of brothers, to the demands of charity."<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>A</sup></a></p>

<p>The Female Orphan Asylum is a fine building on the corner
of Camp and Prytania streets, and the visitor who has never seen
any thing of the kind will be well repaid by an examination. He
will be met at the door by one of the Sisters of Charity, (known
as Nuns,) a lady about forty years old, rather stooping, but mild
and holy, dressed in black, with a hood of the same, partly covering
her head. Her dress is gathered around her waist by a black
belt made of bombazine, to which is attached some keys and Catholic
relics. She beckons you in the house, and proceeds on
before you with a gait as noiseless and nimble as a cat. The
first room you enter is the school for small girls, numbering about
fifty, who all rise simultaneously on your entrance. You then
pass into a room of fifty girls, generally from twelve to sixteen
years of age. Here they exhibit specimens of needle work,
painting, etc., all well executed. These schools are under the
especial care and management of the good sisters, and nothing
can exceed the orderly, neat and well-behaved deportment of the
girls. We next visited the kitchen; if a clean, neat, ungreased
apartment can bear that appellation. There we found the Lady
Superior up to her elbows in dough, and busily assisted by several
charity girls in cooking dinner. She was a fat, healthy looking
lady, about forty years old, and looked like she had more of
the good things of this life at her command, or rather appeared to
have made better use of them than her sisters. The dining-room
is well arranged, so are the dormitories, which are composed of
four spacious rooms, very airy and commodious. Each school
has its dormitory, and every girl has a separate bed, neat and
comfortable, exactly corresponding to her size and length. Just
as the good sister (our conductress) opened the door of the chapel,
she dropped upon her knees and repeated something to herself.
On opening the door, we saw another sister "solitary and alone,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
kneeling, rising and prostrating herself before the altar. She
was deeply engaged in her devotions, and never once turned her
head to look at us.</p>

<p>Being struck with the infinite degree of trouble which the Sisters
must daily encounter in nursing and rearing over one hundred
orphan girls from a month to sixteen years of age, I alluded
to it, she replied, "That is what we are here for. We give up
the allurements of the world to devote our days exclusively in
doing good, and what you call troubles are our pleasures."</p>

<p>This immense building, with four school rooms, four dormitories,
dining rooms and many other apartments, are all under the
management of seven Sisters, who attend to every thing, even
wash and scour the floors, dress and teach the children. But the
most interesting apartment was that of the infants. Here we
found about thirty children about four years old, clean and well
dressed and sending up their innocent and sweet little voices in
singing praises to God! It was almost impossible to notice any
difference in the sizes of this interesting little circle. Not one of
the little sweets had father or mother alive. No one could look
upon them with feelings other than those of pity and love. Like
so many young birds holding their little heads above their nests,
would these sweet little children ask us, "Have you any candy
for me?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES BRANCH MINT.&mdash;THE WATER WORKS.&mdash;MARKETS, ETC.</h3>


<p>The stranger should never leave the Crescent City without seeing
the Mint, where money is made as if by magic. It is situated
in the old Jackson square, between Barrack and Esplanade
streets. It is a fine edifice, having a projecting centre building
with two exterior wings. The walls are strong and thick, plastered
in good imitation of granite; the length, 282 by 108 deep.
This mint was commenced in 1835, and the whole cost of
building, fencing, machinery, and furniture, was $300,000. The
yard is handsomely enclosed with iron railing on a granite basement.
You enter at a fine gate, and passing through the first court
over a block wood pavement, you ascend a flight of granite steps,
and enter in a large passage where sets a pleasant old gentleman,
who requires you to register your name and residence. This being
done, he leads the visitor among the furnaces where the smelting
is performed; then in a large room where the metal is formed
into bars of various sizes by running it through powerful iron rollers.
These bars are then cut out into coins from the size of half
a dime to a doubloon, by means of a machine something like a
punch, but which moves with great regularity, and power, and
despatch. The polite old gentleman then leads you down below,
and in a remote wing stands a man solitary and alone by the side
of the most splendid and beautiful machinery which ever was
made, who puts the cut pieces of coin by twenties into a tube
which fits them exactly, and the machinery stamps them one by
one, with an eagle on one side, and the Goddess of Liberty on the
other. The untiring machinery goes up and down, and stamps
according to different sizes, from eighty to one hundred and
fifty to the minute! and they are received into a beautiful silver
vase below. Before the coin is brought into this finishing room,
it is not counted, but weighed; and after it is here impressed, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
then weighed again. In 1838, the mint coined only the amount
$40,243; 1839, $263,650; 1840, $915,600; 1841, $642,200; 1842,
$1,275,750; 1843, $4,568,000; 1844, $4,208,500; 1845, $1,473,000.
The falling off during the last year mentioned, has been owing
to the state of our foreign exchanges being against the interests
of the mint.</p>

<p>The chief work has consisted in the new coinage of old Spanish
dollars, French, German, and English coins. The unwrought
gold is chiefly from Alabama, and is greatly on the increase. Nothing
is charged for the coinage of pure metal. The expenses
are borne by the Government, and are annually about fifty-two
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>A large portion of the city of Orleans is watered from the large
reservoir in the upper part of the second municipality. An iron
pipe eighteen inches in diameter, is placed in the river twelve feet
below the surface, and through this, great columns of water are
continually ascending by sixty horse power force-pumps, situated in
brick buildings on Tchoupitoulas and Richard streets. The water is
carried under ground for two hundred yards further, and forced up
the reservoir alluded to, which has been made in the manner of an
artificial mound, from the sediment of the river. The reservoir is
built on the top of the mound, and is about three hundred feet
square, walled with brick and cemented, with four apartments in
it, each having about five feet live water in them. Every month
or two, the water is drawn off from two of them, and the deposit
formed six inches deep is scraped off, and the water let in again.
A pavilion in the middle of the reservoir affords a pleasant seat,
and affords you a commanding view of the immediate neighborhood.
The pumps force up 2,280 gallons per minute. The cost of
the works is about $1,490,000; expenses, $17,000; revenue, $75000.
The water is distributed through cast iron pipes from sixteen to
six inches in diameter, and is sold at the rate of three dollars per
head. The daily consumption is near one million three hundred
thousand gallons.</p>

<p>The city of New Orleans is more abundantly blessed, according
to its extent, with good markets than any city on the continent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
They may be found in all directions, affording a great abundance
of the best that the whole Mississippi valley and the far western
plains of Texas can produce.</p>

<p>The great attraction to visitors is the celebrated <span class="smcap">French Market</span>.
The French, English, Spanish, Dutch, Swiss and Italian languages
are employed here in trading, buying, and selling, and a kind of
mongrel mixture and jumble of each and all is spoken by the lower
class in the market. It lies on the Levee, admirably situated, and
extends a long ways. All is hurry, jostling and confusion; the
very drums of your ears ache with the eternal jargon&mdash;with the
cursing, swearing, whooping, hollowing, cavilling, laughing, crying,
cheating and stealing, which are all in full blast. The
screams of parrots, the music of birds, the barking of dogs, the
cries of oystermen, the screams of children, the Dutch girl's organ,
the French negro humming a piece of the last opera&mdash;all are
going it, increasing the novelty of this novel place. The people
engaged in building the tower of Babel, whose language was confounded
and confused for their presumptuous undertaking, never
made a worse jargon or inflicted a greater blow upon harmonious
sounds, than is to be found here. While looking around at the
various commodities exposed for sale, I saw scores of opossums,
coons, crawfish, eels, minks, and frogs, brought there to satiate
the fancy appetite of the French. But what was my astonishment
on seeing a basket of five fat <i>puppies</i> about six weeks old, which
the owner informed me were for French gentlemen to eat! In
charity for the Frenchman's taste, I have sometimes thought
the vender of these little barkers was palming a quiz upon
me. I
hope so.</p>

<p>This is an unrivalled market. Every fish that swims in the
Gulf, every bird that flies in the air, or swims upon the wave,
every quadruped that scours the plains or skulks in dens, which
are usually eaten by men, can be had in great abundance. All
kinds of grain and roots raised in the up country, all the luxuries
of the tropics, are here. The elk of the Osage river, the buffalo
of the Yellowstone, venison of Louisiana, and the bear of Mississippi,
fill the list, and contribute in pandering to the appetites of
luxurious citizens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS.&mdash;THE FRENCH THEATRE.&mdash;THE CARNIVAL.&mdash;THE ST. CHARLES, ETC.</h3>


<p>I cannot undertake to describe the numerous public buildings
which adorn the city of Orleans. I will merely observe that the
stranger would be much entertained and instructed by visiting
the Gas Works, the Chapel of the Ursulines, St. Patrick's Church,
the Cypress Grove Cemetery, and other beautiful resting places of
the dead; the Charity Hospital, the Maison de Sante, the Marine
Hospital, the Municipal Hall, the Workhouses in the First and
Second Municipalities, the City Prisons, the City Hall, the Orleans
Cotton Press, the Commercial Exchange, the Merchants' Exchange,
the Medical College, and many others too numerous to
mention.</p>

<p>A very great object of attraction at night is the Orleans Theatre,
the most conveniently arranged building, perhaps in America.
With a very commodious and elevated pit, with grated boxes on
the sides for persons desiring to be private, two tiers of boxes and
one of galleries above, the whole is so admirably arranged as to
allow spectators every privilege of seeing and hearing. The
pieces performed at this novel theatre are generally well selected
operas, and although the acting is in the French language, yet
the pantomime is so excellent and the costume so much to the life,
that it requires but little practice on the part of the Alabamian to
unravel the plot and become intensely engaged. Every kind of
instrument necessary in producing sweet and harmonious sounds,
is to be found in the orchestra, and the music is alternately melodious
and grand. The dress circle surpasses all others for the
beauty and fashion which it contains. It literally glows with
diamonds and sparkling eyes!! In front are seated ladies most
magnificently dressed, from all parts of the south and west, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
among them sat the beautiful daughter of the hero of Mexico!
As the child of the captor of Monterey, she was the object of attraction
throughout the dress circle, and doubtless was loved by
all for the noble deeds of her brave and patriotic father. On the
sides of the circle are beauties still more richly attired, if possible,
but darker and more effeminate than the former, but pretty
and sweet beyond all description. They are the daughters of Louisianians!</p>

<p>No theatre in the world can be better patronised. Every
night it is crowded with fashionable audiences. For weeks together
seats at an extravagant price are engaged far ahead. In
going away from this little world of gaiety and amusement, the
visitor may justly conclude that Frenchmen never get old! Here
are men portly in appearance and elegant in manners, whose
heads are "silvered o'er with many winters," apparently sixty
and seventy years of age, entering into the merits of the play
with spirits as gay and ardent as the young man of twenty. At
the conclusion of a fine act, they will rise upon their feet and
shout with rapture and delight, "bravo! bravo!! bravissimo!!!
c'est bien!!!!"</p>

<p>I shall continue to speak more frequently of the French and
Spanish population than of the native Americans, because, being
the more novel and strange, they are the most interesting. They
have a great many singular customs and attractive amusements.
Among others, "Mardi-Gras, or Shrove Tuesday," when the
religious holidays are at an end, is of some interest. I saw this
ceremony under unfavorable auspices. It rained the whole day,
and the procession did not exceed an hundred, who constantly
appeared in small detachments, some riding on horseback, others
in open wagons and cabs, but many on foot; all masked and most
fantastically and even ridiculously dressed. I presume the eminently
pious portion of the Catholics do not engage in this celebration,
unless giving it a more serious and respectable turn, for it
struck me as I witnessed it as composed of persons of a low and
vulgar character. Every Mardi-Gras man has his pockets filled
with flour, and as he passes the well-dressed stranger, who excited
by curiosity gets near, throws handfuls upon him, to the amusement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
of those bystanders who fortunately escape. One wagon in
particular contained eight hideous-looking objects, dressed in bear,
panther and buffalo skins, with horns of various descriptions on.
Among them was his Satanic Majesty, with the same old cloven
feet, lashing tail, and black skin. Those on foot fared badly, for
scores of boys would follow them up, and pelt them with sticks and
mud, and in one instance I saw a fellow stripped of his old woman's
habiliments and mask, who looked stupid and ridiculous to
the laughing boys and spectators.</p>

<p>But while quitting a description of this poor celebration, once
so large and interesting, I must not fail to notice the grandest
sight my eyes ever beheld. I was standing on the gallery of the
Verandah; in front of me rose up high in the air the imposing
and magnificent St. Charles. On its granite gallery stood crowds
of the finest race of men upon the globe&mdash;below, the streets
were full, all looking at the Carnival. For four stories high,
every window was full of beauty and fashion. Never had the
remark so often made to me before, been so entirely convincing,
that New Orleans contained more handsome ladies and fine looking
men than any city in the Union. Every thing in front of the
St. Charles is rich and inviting. The men all free and easy and
elegantly apparelled, with forms cast in Nature's best mould;
the ladies all gay, cheerful and beautiful; the cabs and coaches
all elegant, with the most dazzling caparisons covering the noble
horses. The eminent merchant, the learned jurist, the respectable
planter, the dashing young fellow, the officer of the army, all
congregate before the St. Charles, the best house in the world!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE ROADS IN THE ENVIRONS.&mdash;THE TOWN OF CARROLLTON.&mdash;THE WOOD YARDS.&mdash;RIVER-BOTTOMS, ETC.</h3>


<p>Of the various delightful rides in the environs of the city, none
affords so much interest as the route to Carrollton. You reach
that place on a railroad, commencing in the upper part of the second
municipality, and running a third of the way through the
suburbs of Lafayette, the remainder passing over a wide and lovely
plain, with the Mississippi river on your left, and the deep and
dismal swamp on your right. It is impossible to conceive a
more interesting level than this, for as far as the eye can reach,
objects of both nature and art are most agreeably presented.
The road first passes a splendid country seat, resembling in appearance
our imperfect ideas of a French chateau, surrounded
with shrubbery of the greenest shade, with orange trees covered
with buds and blossoms whose fragrance embalms the air, and
burthened with golden globes which richly glitter in the sun.
And next you see spread out upon this beautiful plain, heads of
cattle and sheep grazing upon the soft green sward, which none
but the alluvial bottoms of the noble Mississippi can afford in such
inviting varieties. Further on, you enter a pecan grove, resembling
some of the oaks in our forests, but every tree alike&mdash;all of
the same size&mdash;bearing aloft the nutricious nuts which make them
so celebrated. The road passes by many handsome seats and
villas, the style of which at once indicates the taste and wealth of
the inmates.</p>

<p>While enjoying this interesting ride, my mind suddenly fell
back upon Orleans, and was at once wrapt in thoughts of futurity.
An hundred years hence, where now browze those innocent cattle
in undisturbed silence&mdash;where now grow the green grass,
"the vine and the fig-tree,"&mdash;will then be occupied by churches,
towers, hotels, and theatres! What place is this? It is a part of
New Orleans the queen city of America.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>

<p>Carrollton is a small place, but contains some fine residences;
and there is a large public garden, tastefully laid out, belonging to
the railroad company. The sale of wood seems to be the principal
employment of the inhabitants. Rafts containing one hundred
large logs about fifty feet long, almost entirely of ash, pinned together,
are floated down from all parts of the world above Orleans,
from as high up as Missouri. While winding their way through
the torturous currents of the river, these raftsmen may be considered
the most independent set of people that navigate the great
watery thoroughfare. All
boats and crafts avoid them and they
have nothing to fear. A small hut of the most temporary character,
made of boards, and sometimes the bottom of an old yawl
turned up, is all the covering these amphibious and nondescript
watermen have. Upon landing, the raft is sold to the proprietor
of the wood yard. A log at a time is hauled upon the levee by
large chains attached to a stationary windlass. It is then sawed
into blocks four feet long, bolted up and put in cords which are
sold for four dollars. At one of the wood yards, thirty hands were
employed, and they sold $15,000 worth of wood per year.</p>

<p>I must ask pardon for so often recurring to Mr. Calhoun's great
"inland sea." It is to me the most interesting of all objects. I
sat upon the levee at Carrollton. I saw it in all its might and
majesty, nothing interposing to intercept the view. I thought of
the countless number of rills, of the many creeks, of the numerous
lakes, and of the untold rivers, rising in different regions and latitudes
thousands of miles apart, combining every variety of minerals
known to the continent&mdash;here passing by me, confined in one
vast and deep channel, lashing its banks with violence, and pressing
onward and onward its mighty waters to the briney sea! I
cannot say, "to its ocean home," for it has none. It finds no
resting place in the Gulf like other rivers, but the sea groans and
gives way to its immensity, and we find its discoloured current far
within the tropics! The reader of this number being well acquainted
with the low, marshy, dismal character of the several
mouths of the Mississippi, will doubtless be surprised at being informed
that there is a mountain there near four hundred feet high!
He has only to reflect that the river from Natchez to the Balize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
is usually from three to four hundred feet deep; across the bar
there is only eighteen feet water; beyond the bar, just in the
ocean, the Gulf is unfathomable. So, then, the river in going
into the sea, has to pass over a mountain, which it is strange has
not been washed away, for the river, as before observed, is not
arrested in its onward course by the ocean to much extent.</p>

<p>The levee at Carrollton is considerably higher than the plain
upon which reposes the town. This great work that has occupied
the labor, time, and enterprize of Louisiana for years, appears to
afford a permanent and durable protection from the floods of the
river. It commences at Fort Plaquemines, and extends to Baton
Rouge, the distance of one hundred and sixty-three miles, on the
east side of the river; on the west side it extends as high up as
Arkansas. It will average four feet high and fifteen feet wide,
and follows the river in its winding course. A visitor, seeing no
ditch from which the earth is taken to erect this artificial dyke, is
at first at a loss to know where soil was obtained to make it.
On the margin of the river a continual deposit is forming called
"batture;" this is drawn back from the river and makes the
levee. It soon becomes soil, and has given rise to much litigation,
for ownership is exercised over it when formed. The levee
has not given way in a long time, to do any extensive damage.
Near this place, in 1816, the river rising to an unprecedented
height, broke through and inundated much of Orleans; but governor
Claiborne had a vessel sunk in the crevasse, which
stopped it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>ORLEANS AT NIGHT.&mdash;THE COMMERCE OF THE PLACE.&mdash;THE TWENTY-SECOND OF FEBRUARY.</h3>


<p>When the sun sheds his last rays behind the hills of peaceful
Alabama, then it is that the farmer whistles a note over his last
furrow, and thanks himself that the toils of day are nearly over;
then the hunter checks his horse, blows his last horn and turns
for home; then the lazy angler rises from the green bank, strings
his silvery fish, winds up his lines and quits the quiet stream;
then the children cease to "gambol o'er the plain," and night
soon shrouds all objects in darkness and repose.</p>

<p>Not so with Orleans. Over her massive buildings and pretty
streets, the veil of night is cast in vain! Anon a soft and yellow
light issues from a thousand lamps, and tells that untiring man is
still abroad. Has the merchant pored over his books the whole
day, he at this happy hour sups his tea, and thinks in anticipation
of Monsieur Malet's delightful party. Has the lawyer attended
upon the courts and given audience to clients, he now
forms plans for this night's amusement. Has the laborious
editor
written "copy" by the long hour until exhausted and fatigued, he
now kicks the exchange papers under the table, throws aside his
pen, and recals with delight the Orleans Theatre and the
sweet
music of Norma. Has the gay matron visited and shopped, and
shopped and visited for the last eight hours, she now once more
attires herself for the splendid "route" of Mad. Solon.
Has the
creole maiden danced and sung, and slept and read, and lounged
in flowing dishabille, she now rises from her delicious ottoman
and for the St. Louis masquerade, once more adorns her lovely
form. Has the good and pious man toiled all day in honorable
trade in behalf of his virtuous wife and smiling children, he now
sits around his evening meal, blesses his Maker for "all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
good <span class="smcap">He</span> gives," and catches with joy the sound of the deep-toned
bell, calling him to the worship of his God. Thus may all tastes
and dispositions find accommodation by "Orleans at night."</p>

<p>The cabs and coaches moving in all directions, with lights
attached, resemble at a distance so many 'ignuis fatuis,' or jack
o' the lanterns. They never stop, but go the whole night; for
the gay and dissipated, surfeited with one amusement, seek another,
and it is not uncommon for the same person to have made
the entire rounds of the public amusements in one night. Stepping
out of the theatre at eleven o'clock, they are escorted by the
eager cabmen proposing to convey them to the Quarteroon Ball,
the St. Louis Masquerade, and many other places. By the way,
these cabs are most delightful inventions, easy to get in, fine to
ride in. To prevent cheating on the part of the driver, the police
have arranged the fare, so that the visitor pays one dollar per
hour, as long as he rides. The city is supplied with one thousand
cabs and coaches for public hire. There are fifteen hundred
milk and market wagons. The quantity of milk consumed at the
St. Charles Hotel alone, is eighty gallons per day!</p>

<p>Four thousand drays are constantly moving with merchandise of
all kinds. They are drawn by large mules driven in tandem
style, and although these useful animals are apparently well fed,
they are certainly most unmercifully laden and cruelly beaten. I
should suppose that twelve thousand mules are engaged in the
commerce of Orleans one way and another. What a mart for
Kentucky!</p>

<p>When the reader reflects that this immense city is assisted by
twenty thousand miles of river navigation, extending into all parts
of the western country, which is a world of itself, added to the
commerce which it enjoys through the lakes and the great gulf,
he will not be surprised in casting his eye over the following
items: Number of ships which arrived in 1846, 743; barks, 377;
brigs 447; schooners, 518; flatboats, 2670; arrivals of steamboats,
2763. There are 550 steamboats employed in the river
navigation. The value of produce exported was $72,000,000; of
imports, $35,000,000. Number of lawyers, 300; physicians,
200; commission merchants, 560.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>

<p>This statement proves the commerce of Orleans to be very
great, but it must be borne in mind that it is constantly on the
increase, and no calculations can be made upon it in future, as to
where it will stop. Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, are all yearly
increasing in population and produce; the latter of which must
find a market here. Then I may add the product of another
world not hitherto contributing, the whole western part of the
valley, from the extreme north-western base of the Rocky Mountains,
far, far down to the mouth of the Rio Grande, embracing
the whole of Texas, all the Santa F&#233; territory, and the vast regions
now inhabited by the Cherokees, Foxes, Creeks, Osages, and
other tribes, who roam in "wilds immeasurably spread."</p>

<p>"The country tributary to Orleans" so Norman says, "contains
nearly as many square miles and more tillable ground than
all of continental Europe, and if peopled as densely as England,
would sustain a population of five hundred millions." He is
hardly large enough in his conceptions. Who can tell the future
size of the Crescent City? None but <span class="smcap">Him</span> who numbers the
sands on the sea shore, and notices the sparrows as they fall!</p>

<p>On the twenty-second of February, the hearts of the patriotic
Louisianians were made glad by the roar of cannon and the waving
of flags. The vessels for miles were hung with beautiful
banners of every civilized nation and clime, unfolding their rich
colors to the ocean breeze. When I saw the sons of Spain, and
France, England and Russia, thus doing homage to the memory
of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, the greatest and best man that ever lived, I felt
a spirit of gratitude towards those noble nations, mingled with
pride and satisfaction for the glory of my own country. The military
of Orleans formed upon Canal street and marched through
